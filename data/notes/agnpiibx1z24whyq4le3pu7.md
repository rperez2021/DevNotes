## General Info

Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

If your merge conflict is caused by competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository, you can resolve it on GitHub using the conflict editor.

For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the merge conflict in a local clone of the repository and push the change to your branch on GitHub. You can use the command line or a tool like GitHub Desktop to push the change.
