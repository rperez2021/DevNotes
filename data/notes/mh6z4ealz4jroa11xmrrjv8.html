<p>Unit tests exist to test individual units of software functionality. A unit is a module, component, or function. They’re bits of the program that can work independently of the rest of the program. The presence of unit testing implies that the software is designed in a modular fashion. You may hear once in a while that there are ways to make software “more testable.”</p>
<p>If you find that it’s hard to write unit tests for your program without mocking lots of other things, that’s a sign that your program is not modular enough. Revealing tight coupling (the opposite of modularity) is one of the many important roles that unit tests play in software creation.</p>
<p>Every module should have unit tests, and every application should be made up of modules. In other words, if you’re not writing unit tests, you should be.</p>
<p>When you write a bug report, you should always provide a description, explain what you expected to see, and explain what you actually saw.</p>
<p>Test cases should be written in much the same way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the feature that you’re testing in plain English.</li>
<li>Provide the expected outcome of the test. This part is why many unit tests are called expectations.</li>
<li>Compare that to the actual value.</li>
<li>When a unit tests fails, the error message is your bug report.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple tests assertions provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better readability.</li>
<li>Less code.</li>
<li>Less maintenance.</li>
</ul>
