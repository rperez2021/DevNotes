## General Info

A design sprint is a time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over five full, eight-hour days.

The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users.

Design sprints save time. With a sprint, your team can cut the decision-making process down from several months to a single week.

Sprints also create an effective path to bring a product to market.

Sprints prioritize the user, putting their needs front and center.

Sprints allow you to fast forward into the future to test your product and get customer reactions before making any expensive decisions.

### Five Phases of Design Sprints

1. The understand phase sets your sprint on the right track and helps your team get a clear picture of the design challenge.

2. Ideate - participant takes time to sketch and present their ideas. Plan for user testing which happens in P5. Recruit tgt profile users now.

3. Decide - select which solution from ideate phase to go forward with.

4. Prototype - build 1st version dont need finished product just something to be tested.

5. Testing

### Benefits of Design Sprints

- It's all about the user and their needs.

- Value every person in the room.

- Best ideas rise to the top.

- Lower the risk of unsuccessful debut.

- Versatile can be scheduled at any point during project.

### Planning Design Sprints

2. Call in the experts
3. Find the right space
4. Gather the supplies
5. Establish the rules of the sprint
6. Planning introductions
7. Post sprint planning
