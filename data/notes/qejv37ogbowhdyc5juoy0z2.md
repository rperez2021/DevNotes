## General Info

In Azure Machine Learning, you can deploy a service as an Azure Container Instances (ACI) or to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. For production scenarios, an AKS deployment is recommended, for which you must create an inference cluster compute target. In this exercise, you'll use an ACI service, which is a suitable deployment target for testing, and does not require you to create an inference cluster.
