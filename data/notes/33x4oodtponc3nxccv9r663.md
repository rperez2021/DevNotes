## General Info

REPL (READ, EVAL, PRINT, LOOP) is a computer environment similar to Shell (Unix/Linux) and command prompt. Node comes with the REPL environment when it is installed. System interacts with the user through outputs of commands/expressions used. It is useful in writing and debugging the codes. The work of REPL can be understood from its full form:

Read: It reads the inputs from users and parses it into JavaScript data structure. It is then stored to memory.
Eval: The parsed JavaScript data structure is evaluated for the results.
Print: The result is printed after the evaluation.
Loop: Loops the input command. To come out of NODE REPL, press ctrl+c twice
