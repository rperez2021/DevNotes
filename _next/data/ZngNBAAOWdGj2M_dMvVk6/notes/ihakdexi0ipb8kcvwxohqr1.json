Still, it can make sense from a performance point of view or if the object implementation is tightly coupled (think of low-level kernel structures that execute thousands of times a second). Tightly coupled objects can be hard to implement in some scenarios, and hard to reuse because they refer to and know about (and how to update) many different objects with different interfaces. In other scenarios, tightly coupled objects can be a better option since the compiler will be able to detect errors at compile-time and optimize the code at the CPU instruction level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-solution-does-the-observer-design-pattern-describe\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#what-solution-does-the-observer-design-pattern-describe\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>What solution does the Observer design pattern describe?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Define Subject and Observer objects.</li>\n<li>so that when a subject changes state, all registered observers are notified and updated automatically (and probably asynchronously).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sole responsibility of a subject is to maintain a list of observers and to notify them of state changes by calling their update() operation. The responsibility of observers is to register (and unregister) themselves on a subject (to get notified of state changes) and to update their state (synchronize their state with the subject's state) when they are notified. This makes subject and observers loosely coupled. Subject and observers have no explicit knowledge of each other. Observers can be added and removed independently at run-time. This notification-registration interaction is also known as publish-subscribe.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","desc":"","updated":1605266684036,"created":1595961348801,"stub":false,"custom":{"stub":false,"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"cf4622cd4e7841f93fb3051e6203c8e6","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["uRNDWirv66xgHSdrPwMcw","lcTujcWsxBfPEpzP49YbQ","FTV8hEHhyid0DiEvv9gNj","ph4ta0hoi7x0vch4uoz72hn","boufkx25rro7ysodpanan5g","01u0co3RYjOM1bjpc2qIU","xt9womgr90xi5ui5nezev7b","qpngd6ap92mmahr4bh4gc47","hobifg8vvmmg17kt2z5p36a"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nThis is the root for your Dendron vault.\n\nIf you decide to publish your entire vault, it will be your landing page.
