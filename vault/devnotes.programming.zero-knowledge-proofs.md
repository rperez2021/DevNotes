## General Info

In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.

## Examples

1. Penguin and the Peephole
2. Note in the Combo Box
3. 3 Color Maps

## NP Completeness

NP Complete Problem - a complex problem that when solved proves a lot of similar problems.
