## General Info

Machine Learning is the foundation for most artificial intelligence solutions, and the creation of an intelligent solution often begins with the use of machine learning to train a predictive model using historic data that you have collected.

### Supervised Machine Learning

- Regression - Historic Data to predict a numeric value
- Classification - Model predicts a class to which an item belongs

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

- Clustering types of data bits
