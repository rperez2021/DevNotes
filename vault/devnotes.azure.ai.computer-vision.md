## Computer Vision Models and Capabilities

- Image Classification

- Object Detection

- Semantic Segmentation - Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong.

- Image Analysis - You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.

- Face detection, analysis and recognition

- Optical Character Recognition - is a technique used to detect and read text in images. You can use OCR to read text in photographs (for example, road signs or store fronts) or to extract information from scanned documents such as letters, invoices, or forms.
