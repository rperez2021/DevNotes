## General Info

Dependency injection (DI) is a programming pattern in which a dependency is passed using the parameters instead of instantiating it within the function or class. DI enables creating isolated individual components within application code and makes it easy to switch those dependencies in the future as the requirement changes. Passing parameters as a dependency also allows to easily unit test those components in isolation by injecting their mocked version.
