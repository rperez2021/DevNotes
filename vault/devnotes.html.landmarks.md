## General Info

Landmarks are HTML elements that act as regions of a page. There are seven native HTML elements that define these landmark regions:

- `<aside>`
- `<footer>`
- `<form>`
- `<header>`
- `<main>`
- `<nav>`
- `<section>`

By properly using landmarks and headings, you provide users of assistive technologies a more operable and understandbale page: not only can screen readers navigate a page via landmarks and headings by opening a menu in their screen reader, but these elements also have their roles announced to provide additional context.
