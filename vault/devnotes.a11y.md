## General Notes

You Are Not the User: The False-Consensus Effect, [Link](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/false-consensus/)

The ` <button> ` element should be used for any interaction that performs an action on the current page. The ` <a> ` element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another view.

Adding an HTML Attribute ` tabindex="0" ` allows tab focus. These can also be numbered to order tabbing.

Synthetic Click Activator

Screen reader users generally use headings to navigate a page quickly. Using heading in orders is super important.

### Modals

The final boss battle of a11y! ðŸ˜‚

With Modals make sure that when you close a modal focus is returned to where the modal was opened.

Make sure that the modal is a created just as child of the body, do not nest it far in the document or it will make it harder to navigate.

[WICG Inert Polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/inert) was created to make a DOM Node uninteractable and prevent the user from navigating to that node.
