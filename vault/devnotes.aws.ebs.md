## Cheat Sheet

- EBS Handles deployment from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.
- When you want to run an application but you dont want to have to think about the underlying infrastructure.
- It costs nothing to use EBS on AWS only the provisioned resources (S3, RDS, EC2, ELB)
- Recommended for test environments
