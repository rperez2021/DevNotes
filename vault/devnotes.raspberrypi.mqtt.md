## General Information

MQTT is a lightweight pub/sub machine to machine network protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations that have devices with resource constraints or limited network bandwidth. It must run over a transport protocol that provides ordered, lossless, bi-directional connectionsâ€”typically, TCP/IP. It is an open OASIS standard and an ISO recommendation (ISO/IEC 20922).
