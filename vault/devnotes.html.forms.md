## General Info

## Tips

Note: You can also use the `<input>` element with the corresponding type to produce a button, for example `<input type="submit">`. The main advantage of the `<button>` element is that the `<input>` element only allows plain text in its label whereas the `<button>` element allows full HTML content, allowing more complex, creative button content.

Many assistive technologies will use the `<legend>` element as if it is a part of the label of each control inside the corresponding `<fieldset>` element. For example, some screen readers such as Jaws and NVDA will speak the legend's content before speaking the label of each control.

Each time you have a set of radio buttons, you should nest them inside a `<fieldset>` element. There are other use cases, and in general the `<fieldset>` element can also be used to section a form.

Test forms you create on screen readers!
